50845,0,OpenSSL Detection,5432,tcp,cpe:/a:openssl:openssl,,The remote service appears to use OpenSSL to encrypt traffic.,"Based on its response to a TLS request with a specially crafted server name extension, it seems that the remote service is using the OpenSSL library to encrypt traffic.  Note that this plugin can only detect OpenSSL implementations that have enabled support for TLS extensions (RFC 4366).",
51192,2,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,5432,tcp,,,The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :    - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.    - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.    - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.  If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.
57582,2,SSL Self-Signed Certificate,5432,tcp,,,The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.,"The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.   Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.
15901,2,SSL Certificate Expiry,5432,tcp,,,The remote server's SSL certificate has already expired.,This plugin checks expiry dates of certificates associated with SSL- enabled services on the target and reports whether any have already expired.,Purchase or generate a new SSL certificate to replace the existing one.
70544,0,SSL Cipher Block Chaining Cipher Suites Supported,5432,tcp,,,"The remote service supports the use of SSL Cipher Block Chaining ciphers, which combine previous blocks with subsequent ones.","The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that operate in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.  These cipher suites offer additional security over Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, but have the potential to leak information if used improperly.",
20007,4,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,5432,tcp,,,The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known weaknesses.,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws, including:    - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.    - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.  An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.  Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.  NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong cryptography'.",Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0. Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.
57041,0,SSL Perfect Forward Secrecy Cipher Suites Supported,5432,tcp,,,"The remote service supports the use of SSL Perfect Forward Secrecy ciphers, which maintain confidentiality even if the key is stolen.",The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) encryption.  These cipher suites ensure that recorded SSL traffic cannot be broken at a future date if the server's private key is compromised.,
156899,0,SSL/TLS Recommended Cipher Suites,5432,tcp,,,The remote host advertises discouraged SSL/TLS ciphers.,"The remote host has open SSL/TLS ports which advertise discouraged cipher suites. It is recommended to only enable support for the following cipher suites:  TLSv1.3:   - 0x13,0x01 TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   - 0x13,0x02 TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   - 0x13,0x03 TLS13_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256  TLSv1.2:   - 0xC0,0x2B ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   - 0xC0,0x2F ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   - 0xC0,0x2C ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384   - 0xC0,0x30 ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384   - 0xCC,0xA9 ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305   - 0xCC,0xA8 ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305  This is the recommended configuration for the vast majority of services, as it is highly secure and compatible with nearly every client released in the last five (or more) years.",Only enable support for recommened cipher suites.
78479,2,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),5432,tcp,,CVE-2014-3566,It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.,"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.",Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.
42873,2,SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32),5432,tcp,,CVE-2016-2183,The remote service supports the use of medium strength SSL ciphers.,"The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium strength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryption that uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits, or else that uses the 3DES encryption suite.  Note that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strength encryption if the attacker is on the same physical network.",Reconfigure the affected application if possible to avoid use of medium strength ciphers.
65821,2,SSL RC4 Cipher Suites Supported (Bar Mitzvah),5432,tcp,,"CVE-2013-2566,CVE-2015-2808",The remote service supports the use of the RC4 cipher.,"The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.  If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.","Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers. Consider using TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM suites subject to browser and web server support."
104743,2,TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detection,5432,tcp,,,The remote service encrypts traffic using an older version of TLS.,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has a number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0 mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.  As of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that aren’t enabled for TLS 1.2 and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.  PCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30, 2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits.","Enable support for TLS 1.2 and 1.3, and disable support for TLS 1.0."

The problem is due to a Debian packager removing nearly all sources of entropy in the remote version of OpenSSL.   An attacker can easily obtain the private part of the remote key and use this to decipher the remote session or set up a man in the middle attack.,"Consider all cryptographic material generated on the remote host to be guessable.  In particuliar, all SSH, SSL and OpenVPN key material should be re-generated."

51192,2,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,25,tcp,,,The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :    - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.    - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.    - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.  If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.  Please note the following :  - This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.  - Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.",
